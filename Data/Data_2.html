                <p>Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example, <i>perc_enjoy</i> is much higher on average than <i>perc_usefulness</i>, which also has a large variance. This suggests that a segment of users may not have considered the system useful even though they enjoyed using it.</p>
            </aside>
            <p>Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet. If necessary, rearrange columns so that data requiring summary, those with <b>continuous</b> values, are adjacent. (In the spreadsheet, the continuous values of <i>perc_enjoy, perc_usefulness</i>, and <i>perc_ease_of_use</i> are already adjacent.)</p>
            <p>Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring summary, making sure not to include variable labels.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to <b>Tools &gt; Add-Ins...</b> and make sure <b>Analysis ToolPak</b> is checked. Click OK.</li>
                <li>Go to <b>Tools &gt; Data Analysis</b> and select <b>Descriptive Statistics</b>. Click OK.</li>
                <li>Enter the input range in the blank and check <b>Summary Statistics</b>. Click OK.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet. Rename this spreadsheet Descriptive_Stats. Label the output according to the variables. For example, <i>Column 1</i> should be <i>perc_enjoy</i>. Your Descriptive_Stats spreadsheet should now look like Figure 4.</p>
            <p>Analyzing descriptive statistics is a great way to start appraising a dataset before running inferential statistics. What insights about the dataset can you glean from the summary statistics for <i>perc_usefulness</i> and <i>perc_ease_of_use</i>?</p>
